# Garrys-mod-Global-Settings-Menu
 A global settings menu for addon creators to easily create convars that users can use to modify things.



#Tutorial
Check out the template file on how to easily make your own tree:https://github.com/SgtFlex/Garrys-mod-Global-Settings-Menu/blob/main/lua/settings_panel_info/template.lua
for a way to create your own settings for your addon or somebody else's if the console commands are provided.

All you have to do is have a directory under your lua folder called "settings_panel_info". Then add a .lua file named whatever you want, such as "your_addon_name_settings.lua" (Of course substitutde your_addon_name with the name of your addon WITH underscores instead of spaces). Simply follow the template file from there.
